  <h2>Past Work Expiriences</h2>
  <img src="ProjectPlanImages\cartoon past.png"alt="past">
  <p>During my High school time, I was encouraged by my family to involve myself in many activities.
    All with the purpose of me gaining expiriences and knowledge of more things.
    I was a volunteer in ecological activities, such as picking up trash and recycling in my community.
    I also went to my local elementary school to provide art classes to children. Additionally I provided assistance to the elderly.
    It was a rewarding experience to be involed in my school, inolving myself as a volunteer for traditional events
    such as community parades, expo-businesses, Miss Cecytej contests, and cultural events such as Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Mother's Day, and Independence Day.</p>
