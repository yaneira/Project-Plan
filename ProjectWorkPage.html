    <p>During my High school time, I was encouraged by my family to involve myself in many activities.
      All with the purpose of me gaining expiriences and knowledge of more things.
      I was a volunteer in ecological activities, such as picking up trash and recycling in my community.
      I also went to my local elementary school to provide art classes to children. Additionally I provided assistance to the elderly.
      It was a rewarding experience to be involed in my school, inolving myself as a volunteer for traditional events
      such as community parades, expo-businesses, Miss Cecytej contests, and cultural events such as Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Mother's Day, and Independence Day.</p>
